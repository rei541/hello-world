# hello-world
The basic hello world starter repository!

A little bit about myself - I'm statistical programmer with a background in computer science, economics, and public policy. I think data is super important and can help humanity make better sense of the world. Otherwise, you'll see me exercising (running or yoga) or playing video games.
